            <td>I have 800 hours on the game on console. It is a real problem. But I decided to do it again on a whole other platform! <br> Now that I've built a PC that can actually run games, I downloaded Warframe again, and in the span of 15 hours, have mangaged to get up to Chains of Harrow, a quest which typically takes around 30-50 hours to get to. I'm basically playing the game on New Game+ mode, which is fun, but man do some of these people not know what they're doing. But at the same time, I remember, I was as bad if not worse when them when I started. I started playing <b>WHEN CHAINS OF HARROW</b> came out, back in 2017. I was 10.<br> I was new to the game, and I sucked at games. So I've been cutting them some slack recently. Funny enough, my wonderful girlfriend's little brother started playing Warframe. Poor, poor child. I would warn him. But I won't. He's wanted me to play with him, but I only play to speedrun to late game right now, and so even though I restarted when he started, I'm hours and hours ahead of him with less time, so I don't want to carry him with whatever he's doing. Idk. Love the game though, 10/10.</td>
