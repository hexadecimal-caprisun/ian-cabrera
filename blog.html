            <td>I have 800 hours on the game on console. It is a real problem. But I decided to do it again on a whole other platform! <br> Now that I've built a PC that can actually run games, I downloaded Warframe again, and in the span of 15 hours, have mangaged to get up to Chains of Harrow, a quest which typically takes around 30-50 hours to get to. I'm basically playing the game on New Game+ mode, which is fun, but man do some of these people not know what they're doing. But at the same time, I remember, I was as bad if not worse when them when I started. I started playing <b>WHEN CHAINS OF HARROW</b> came out, back in 2017. I was 10.<br> I was new to the game, and I sucked at games. So I've been cutting them some slack recently. Funny enough, my wonderful girlfriend's little brother started playing Warframe. Poor, poor child. I would warn him. But I won't. He's wanted me to play with him, but I only play to speedrun to late game right now, and so even though I restarted when he started, I'm hours and hours ahead of him with less time, so I don't want to carry him with whatever he's doing. Idk. Love the game though, 10/10.</td>

            The Israel-Plaestine conflict just kicked it up a notch over the weekend. Hamas terrorists invaded by Land, Air, and Sea Ã  la Red Dawn. They shot upwards of 5000 missiles at civilain areas in the first day alone. They focused on civilain areas and did numerous horrible things, many of which are war crimes that I cant type because of the monitoring policy of the device I am writing this on, but it is truly a tragedy. I don't have the expertise to comment further on this scenario, so I will link articles explaining historical context and what is happening currently on the right. <br><br> Moving on from that grim topic, an even worse one! <br>Warframe!!!!<br>

            I've been skipping all non-story quests, so every single one that is for a warframe that I don't need to do the story, I've been skipping. Including the open world ones. Which is a pain in my side. Mostly because I need to do them to do the New War quest. At 50 hours, I've completed the railjack, and all prerequisite quests. But I must make the Nechramech. The beautiful Voidrig. And so I must grind. And I must make a better amp. And so I must grind. And I need to farm MR. And so I must grind.<br>so.<br>much.<br>grinding.<br>I'm MR 8, and it will likely take me another 5-10 hours of grinding to get my Nechramech. But I will soon be there. And once I do that I will grind more to complete all of the nodes. And then I will grind to get all the steel path arcanes. And then I will grind to get all of the Arbitration mods. <br> I love selling my soul!
